# Activity 2: Basic Photo Edits

Let's move on with using GIMP and do some basic edits to a photo. If you have an questions, please ask!

1.  Download this image for the exercise: [woman in red and white shirt standing near white wall photo - Free Blonde Image](https://unsplash.com/photos/xEX_o0haX6c){:target="_blank"}
2.  Open the photo in GIMP by going to **File -> Open** in the upper menu. Find where you saved the photo and open it. If your browser automatically saved it for you, it is probably in your **Downloads** folder. It may pop up with another window asking to **Convert to RGB Working Space**. (_Note: there are certain circumstances wherein you may need to convert an image to a different color profile, such as when importing from a scanner or camera. But in this case, it is not necessary._) Click on **Keep**
3.  We are first going to make a copy of this image before we edit it so that we keep a full size copy of our original. To do this, click on **Image** in the top menu and then click on **Duplicate**. This will create a new copy of the image. You will now see above your image that you have two tabs open in GIMP with the thumbnails of the two files. If you click on the thumbnails, a little "X" appears next to the active one and at the top of the software the filename appears. The new copy will be called **[Untitled]** until you save it with a new name. Make sure you are working in the one you plan to resize. It's best to close the original to avoid confusion by clicking on the little "X" next to the thumbnail
4.  **Converting to Black and White:**
    -   Click on **Colors** in the top menu (see right), then **Desaturate**, and then **Desaturate...**. A small window will pop up. Make sure **Luminance** is selected as the **Mode**. Click **OK**
    -   Next, click on **Colors** in the top menu, then **Desaturate**, and then **Mono Mixer**. A small window will pop up. You can drag up or down each of these channels to increase or decrease each colour channel, which will impact their intensity in the image. (This can be particularly useful for photos with lots of the sky in them.) Click **OK**
    -   Click on **Colors** in the top menu again, and then click on **Curves**. This will bring up a small window. Click on the diagonal line in three places to **create three evenly spaced round handles** (see first image to the right). Once the handles are there, you can grab them with your mouse and **drag them up or down** to make adjustments in your photo. The wave form in the back shows the lights and darks in your image
