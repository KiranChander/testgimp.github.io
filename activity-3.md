# Activity 3: Two Ways to Change Image Dimensions

In this activity we are going to change the aspect retio of an image without cropping it so that we don't lose any quality. The reason for showing you two ways is so you learn a couple of different useful skills in GIMP while you do it. If you have any questions, please ask!

1.  Download [this image](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/ice-cream-drawing-pencil-759591/){:target="_blank"} for the exercise
2.  Open the photo in GIMP by going to **File -> Open** in the upper menu. Find where you saved the photo and open it. If your browser automatically saved it for you, it is probably in your **Downloads** folder. It may pop up with another window asking to **Convert to RGB Working Space**. (_Note: there are certain circumstances where you may need to convert an image to a different color profile, such as when importing from a scanner or camera. But in this case, it is not necessary._) Click on **Keep**
3.  We are first going to make a copy of this image before we edit it so that we keep a full size copy of our original. To di this, click on **Image** in the top menu and then click on **Duplicate**. This will create a new copy of the image. You will now see above your image that you have two tabs open in GIMP with the thumbnails of the two files. If you click on the thumbnails, a little "X" appears next to the active one and at the top of the software the filename appears. The new copy will be called **[Untitled]** until you save it with a new name. Make sure you are working in the one you plan to resize. It's best to close the original to avoid confusion by clicking on the little "X" next to the thumbnail
4.  **Changing Canvas Size:**
    -   Click on **Image -> Canvas Size**. This will pop up a window with **Canvas Size** options. For this example, we are going to turn this graphic from a rectangle into a square, so to do that we will simply make sure that the lower number in **Height** pixels is increased to the same number as the **Width** by clicking in the box and typing. Your GIMP may have this number in "Pixels" or in "Inches",
